		After I graduate this spring, I will be moving to Clemson, South Carolina, where I will be attending graduate school in the Fall. The program I will be entering is a doctoral program in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, an applied discipline of social psychology. I will study various topics germane to I/O Psychology, like personnel selection, and performance appraisals. I will also work in a lab with my advisor, where we will conduct research on such unique topics as resilient infrastructures, and mutual monitoring in teams.

    <h3><span>More about I/O Psychology</span></h3>
    <p>
I/O Psychology is the 14th division of the APA, and it is one of the most popular fields of Psychology, after Clinical Psychology. <br> The Society for Industrial/Organizational Psychology (SIOP), describes the discipline as
        </p>
    <blockquote> 
        <p>
        Industrial-organizational (I-O) psychology is the scientific study of working and the application of that science to workplace issues facing individuals, teams, and organizations. The scientific method is applied to investigate issues of critical relevance to individuals, businesses, and society. 
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
IO Psychology was ranked #1 among the fastest growing occupations, poised to grow at a rate of 53% by 2022, according to a study done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2014. However, it is worth noting that it is a very niche profession. This large uptick in growth translates to an estimated increase into only 900 jobs (Allen Farham, ABCNews, 2014).
